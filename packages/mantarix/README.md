# Mantarix
Mantarix Engine is a fork of the Flet project that aims to simplify and increase the efficiency, optimization, and security of Python source code.
Mantarix follows the Flet architecture. Its differences in the core and build tools are the addition of layers of obfuscation in compiling Python application code and managing extensions and building local modules specific to each specific version of the project.
